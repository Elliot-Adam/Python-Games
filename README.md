Some games like Tic Tac Toe and rock paper scissors are games played in the terminal

There are only small projects that do quick math and stuff like that

in order to change what is being ran in Playground, just comment and uncomment whatever in the

if I am only using one image or sound file for a project, I will just name it the name of the project instead of putting it in a new folder
